//Change prestiges as we go (original idea thanks to Hider)
//The idea is like this. We will stick to Dagger until the end of the run, then we will slowly start grabbing prestiges, so we can hit the Prestige we want by the last zone.
//The keywords below "Dagadder" and "GambesOP" are merely representative of the minimum and maximum values. Toggling these on and off, the script will take care of itself, when set to min (Dagger) or max (Gambeson).
//In this way, we will achieve the desired "maxPrestige" setting (which would be somewhere in the middle, like Polearm) by the end of the run. (instead of like in the past where it was gotten from the beginning and wasting time in early maps.)
